<p>Welcome to Brickwig,</p>
<p>My name is Scott and I am coming out of the dark ages of LEGOÂ® building.  This might sound crazy but I enjoy sorting the parts and making sure each one has it's place. It's a fun adventure to try and find new parts every day and I hope to find something you might need to complete your project.</p>
<p>I make it a point to not have parts in my inventory that I would not like to receive myself if I were buying them (i.e. no significant damage such as major bite marks, excessive scratches, fading, cracks, etc.).</p>
<p>All new minifigures come unassembled unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Please contact me for any reason regarding your order if you feel like something is wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
<p>~Scott</p>

<oL>
<li>
Allow 1-2 business days for an invoice. (I typically send within 24 hours after order has been placed).
</li>
<li>
Invoices will be sent only after parts from order have been gathered from inventory (so I can verify them).
</li>
<li>
All orders must be paid within 5 days after invoice has been sent. After 5 days, I reserve the right to cancel the order.
</li>
<li>
All payments will cover the invoiced total, and will be made through PayPal.
</li>
<li>
All sales are final (exception: See #6).
</li>
<li>
If I make a mistake in an order, contact me ASAP regarding the issue, so it can be resolved (I typically offer immediate refunds/exchanges).
</ol>

<p>All orders will be shipped via the United States Postal Service at the following rates:</p>
<p><b>USPS First Class Mail (less than 13oz) - Starting at $2.50 (Includes USPS Tracking Number)</b>
<br>Domestic Shipping chart based on shopping cart weight<br>
less than 1oz: $2.50<br>
1oz-1.99oz: $3.50<br>
2oz-4.99oz: $4.00<br>
5oz-11.99oz: $4.50
</p>

<p><b>USPS Priority Mail (orders over 13oz) - Starting at $5.95 (Includes USPS Tracking Number)</b>
<br>Domestic Shipping chart based on size of order. These prices come directly from USPS, I don't charge extra for Priority Mail.<br>
Small flat rate box: $5.95<br>
Medium flat rate box: $12.65<br>
Large flat rate box: $17.90
</p>

<p>International packages can either be shipped First Class or Priority. Both methods will come with a Customs Form number which may be helpful in locating lost packages but cannot be used to track the package once it leaves the United States. Will provide quote on international shipping once order is placed.</p>

<p>Invoices will only total the cost of your items + shipping. There are no other fees. I want to make it easy for you to determine your total cost from the charts above.</p>
<p>I use all new materials (envelopes, bubble wrap, tape, baggies, etc.) and pack very carefully to prevent damage/loss to your order in shipping)</p>
<p>All orders will be shipped within 1-2 days after payment has been received (I typically ship the day payment has been made).</p>
<p>All orders will only ship to verified PayPal shipping addresses, unless noted otherwise by Buyer (I check to make sure the PayPal address matches your BrickLink address).</p>
